This is my FINAL project about 'Data transmission between mobile phone and Arduino board for use in physics lab'

For Start we will check 'Do you turn on your Bluetooth?' 
Yes, If you turn on it you will login for use my App

And then after login you MUST connect for Arduino devices if you not connect you will not send Data

Last, I design this 'Behind connect and send data from device to mobile will show Data in Table'

And... Yes this is my Final project I'm very proud of this work, yes! It might not be the best job but it's a job that makes me love programming.
